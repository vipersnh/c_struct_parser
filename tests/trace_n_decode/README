Files Overview :
    struct_header.h -> This file contains traced structures definitions and id of each traced structure.

    gen_trace.c     -> This file contains source to generate a test trace.bin which will be decoded by python
                       test code, and dump contents of each traced structure into a file.
    decode_trace.py -> This file contains source to decode trace.bin generated by gen_trace.c into corresponding
                       structure fields and output it on stdout

Trace file format :
    <trace_preamble_struct_t>
    <trace_header_struct_t>
    <Bytes of traced structure of structure as defined in preceding header>
    <trace_header_struct_t>
    <Bytes of traced structure of structure as defined in preceding header>
    <trace_header_struct_t>
    <Bytes of traced structure of structure as defined in preceding header>
    <trace_header_struct_t>
    <Bytes of traced structure of structure as defined in preceding header>
    <trace_header_struct_t>
